Hey man, nice beany.

It's cool to see the tape over the video camera on your macbook, but honestly the real security worry is the people around you.

You never know who could be watching.

I couldn't catch the full email account you were checking your in webmail something bok_C??y@bok.id.au something something bok consultancy .com.au and bok.id.au etc etc

Anyway hopefully this wasn't too weird of an experience for you. Nice work on your OpenANX, Etherium, DAO, Golem projects!

Keep up the good work! Why does everyone get off at Lewisham anyway?

pound antisec?
